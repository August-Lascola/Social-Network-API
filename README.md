## INTRODUCTION
---------------
The completed Social Network API will use MongoDB, Express.js, and moment.js to create an API for a social media site. The completed product will allow users to share their thoughts, add friends, and react to friends' thoughts. This project is still in its early stages.

## REQUIREMENTS
--------------
Express, Mongoose, Moment 

## Installation
-------------
To run the file, install node using npm install, then 
npm i express
npm i mongoose 

## FUNCTIONALITY
----------------
Currently, there is no functionality. I have created the file structure and have a rough idea of what I would do in the future, but as it stands now the website has no practical functionality.
